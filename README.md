# Research-Thesis: A Global Analysis of Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development: Role of Financial  Development 

**Reseaech Problem**
How does renewable energy consumption influence sustainable development, and what is the moderating role of financial development in promoting high human development with ecological sustainability?

 Countries with high CO2 emissions and material footprint currently enjoy very high Human Development scores. This presents a critical challenge: what strategies can low human development countries embrace to attain high human development without deepening environmental degradation?

**1.3	Objectives of Study**
The followings are objective of this underlying study:
1.	To estimate the impact of renewable energy on sustainable development for sustainable and unsustainable countries.
2.	To evaluate the impact of renewable energy on sustainable development through financial development for sustainable and unsustainable countries.

**1.4	Hypothesis of Study**

**H1:** Renewable energy has a positive impact on sustainable development.
**H2:** Financial development enhances the impact of renewable energy on sustainable development.

The result revealed that renewable energy consumption stimuli sustainable development in LHD-SEI, LHD-UEI.and VHHD-UEI. Financial development enhances the sustainable development in LHD-SEI. While financial development reduces the sustainable development in LHD-UEI and VHHD-UEI. In addition, financial development enhances the nexus between renewable energy consumption and sustainable development in LHD-SEI and VHHD-UEI. On the other hand, financial development reduces the connection between renewable energy consumption and sustainable development in LHD-UEI. 

****Recommendation:**

**1.**Policies should be designed that enhance renewable energy consumption
**2.**Financial development should be used in a way that spurs renewable energy-sustainable development nexus and sustainable development
